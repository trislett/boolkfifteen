Privacy Policy for BoolkaFifteen
Last Updated: June 1, 2025
This Privacy Policy describes how "BoolkaFifteen" (the "App"), an open-source 15-puzzle game, handles information. This App is provided as an open-source project under the GNU General Public License v3.0 (GPLv3), and its source code is available on GitHub at [https://github.com/trislett/boolkfifteen].

1. Information We Do Not Collect
We understand the importance of your privacy. The App is designed to be a simple, offline puzzle game. As such:

No Personal Data Collection: The App does not collect, store, transmit, or share any personally identifiable information (PII) from you. This includes, but is not limited to, your name, email address, location, device identifiers (beyond what the operating system might use for its own purposes), or contacts.
No User Accounts: The App does not require you to create an account or log in.
No Server Interaction: The App operates entirely locally on your device and does not communicate with any external servers for its core gameplay functionality.
No Tracking or Analytics: The App does not use any third-party analytics, advertising services, or tracking mechanisms to monitor your usage.
2. Information You Provide (Custom Image Feature)
The App includes a feature that allows you to select an image from your device's local storage to use as the puzzle background.

Local Processing: When you select an image, it is processed locally on your device to create the puzzle pieces.
No Upload or Storage by Us: This image is not uploaded to any external server, nor is it stored persistently by the App beyond the current game session in a way that is accessible to us. If you select a new image or the app is reset, the previously selected image data (if held in temporary memory) is discarded. The original image on your device remains untouched by the App, other than being read for display.
Image Cropping: The App may utilize an image cropping functionality (e.g., via an integrated library or a system intent) to allow you to select a square portion of your chosen image. This cropping process also occurs locally on your device.
3. Permissions Requested
The App may request the following permissions, if necessary, for specific features:

Read Storage (or access to Photos/Media): This permission is required only if you choose to use the "Load Custom Image" feature. It allows the App to access the image you select from your device's gallery or file system. The App only accesses the specific image you choose and does not scan or access other files. If you do not use this feature, this permission is not utilized.
4. Third-Party Libraries
The App may include open-source third-party libraries to provide certain functionalities (e.g., an image cropping library). We endeavor to use reputable libraries. While this Privacy Policy covers the App itself, you may wish to review the privacy policies of any significant third-party libraries if you have specific concerns, though their data handling should generally be confined to the local device for the features used in this App.
5. Data Security
Since the App does not collect or store your personal data, the primary security consideration relates to the images you choose to load from your device. These images are processed locally. We recommend you manage the security of your own device and the images stored on it.
6. Children's Privacy
The App is intended for a general audience and does not knowingly collect any personal information from children under the age of 13 (or the relevant age of consent in your jurisdiction). If you believe that a child has provided us with personal information, please contact us so that we can take appropriate action.
7. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy within the App or on the App's GitHub repository. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted.
8. Open Source and GPLv3
This App is licensed under the GNU General Public License v3.0. You are free to use, study, share, and improve the software under the terms of this license. The source code is available at [https://github.com/trislett/boolkfifteen]. This Privacy Policy is separate from the GPLv3 license but aims to be transparent about data handling within the context of the App's operation.
